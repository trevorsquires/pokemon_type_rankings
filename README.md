# Pokemon Type Rankings

Competitive Pokemon has evolved into an extremely complex and interesting field. At the simplest level, the strength of a Pokemon is closely tied to the strength of its type. Here we will take three different mathematical approaches to ranking each of the 18 Pokemon types.
For the theoretical documentation of these approaches, please navigate to [my website](http://trevorsquires.com/content). This repo contains the accompanying code for computing the solutions. 

Each script in this repo (duality, fixed_point, and markov_chain) contains the numerical efforts generate a type ranking by a different approach. 
The results are stored in `type_values_df` for single type rankings or `dual_type_values_df` for dual type rankings.
